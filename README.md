# SCPI
BTD6 Streaming Channel Points Integration


# Installation Instructions
To use this, please grab the required Dependencies from the specific Release (probably MelonLoader and BTD6 ModHelper).

If extracting the relevant MelonLoader zip archive to the BTD6 Directory does not fully install MelonLoader, use their installer and point it at the BTD6 executable. Afterwards,
drop SCPI.dll and the BTD6ModHelper dll into the Mods Folder.

* Upon first boot of the Game with the Mod, you will be prompted to log in with Twitch. This will save an authentication token to talk with Twitch.
* Once authenticated, the Channel Point Rewards are created. **This will fail if you do not have access to Channel Points. You must be a Twitch Affilliate or above.**
* Afterwards, you should go to [Your Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/viewer-rewards/channel-points/rewards) and set the rewards up to your liking.
* Start a Game!
